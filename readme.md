# Program ONE - Oracle Next Education
This repository contains all the content studied and projects developed during my participation in the ONE program.

## What is ONE?
ONE is an education and employability program with the social objective of training people in technology and connecting them with the job market through partner companies that support the program.

## My trajectory in the program
I participated in the ONE program stages, which were divided into four main phases: Application, Selection, Mandatory Training and AlumniONE, totaling 6 months of course.

In the Selection phase, I participated in two initial training courses on personal development, such as Learning to Learn, Focus: Bringing More Results to Your Daily Life, Habits and Productivity, LinkedIn, among others. In addition, I had an introduction to programming, where I learned programming logic, functions and lists, differences between HTML, CSS and JavaScript, file structure, classes, element positioning, headers, footers, variables, as well as Git and GitHub.

I was pleased to pass the Selection phase and chose the Front-End track to continue with the mandatory training. In the technical training sessions, I learned about Flexbox and responsiveness, manipulating elements in the DOM, array methods, consuming and manipulating API data, creating requests, validating forms, and a track focused on the React library, where I learned about how components work, React Router with JavaScript, styling components with Styled Components, handling files, and managing global state with Context API. In addition, I participated in courses on entrepreneurship, agility, and career leadership.

And of course, that wasn't all, we also had some challenges:

- Text decoder with Javascript
- Portfolio
- AluraGeek
- AluraFlix
